This project has 4 parts: 
Part 1: Create a PIO project to blink on board LED or an external GPIO.
Part 2: Create a PIO project to blink three LEDs connected to GPIO13, 14, and 15 at the same time with frequency of 2, 4, 8 Hz.
Part 3: Implement a PWM program using PIO to dim an LED connected to GPIO 15.
Part 4: Implement a PWM to dim three LEDs in synchronously.
