**Raspberry Pi Pico PIO Project**

This project has 4 parts: 

Part 1 - we create a PIO project to blink on board LED or an external GPIO. 

Part 2 - we create a PIO project to blink three LEDs connected to GPIO13, 14, and 15 at the same time with frequency of 2, 4, 8 Hz. 

Part 3 - we implement a PWM program using PIO to dim an LED connected to GPIO 15. 

Part 4 - we implement a PWM to dim three LEDs in synchronously. A demo video has been pushed to showcase the project.

Hardware used: RPi Pico, a breadboard, LEDs, resistors, push buttons, and jumper wires.

Software used: GNU Arm Embedded toolchain, Mingw-w64 for Windows native builds, CMake, Visual Studio Code.
